# iCalSyncHub

iCalSyncHub is a lightweight Python program that synchronizes multiple online iCal calendars into a single merged calendar. The merged calendar is then shared as an iCal file, which can be hosted on a web server or used locally. Designed for simplicity and automation, it periodically updates the merged calendar based on a configurable sync interval.

## Features
- **Multi-Calendar Support**: Combine events from two or more iCal calendars into one.
- **Automatic Syncing**: Automatically updates the merged calendar at a specified interval.
- **Custom Configuration**: Use a simple `.ini` file to configure calendar URLs, output location, and sync frequency.
- **Portable Output**: Generates a standard `.ics` file compatible with popular calendar apps like Google Calendar, Outlook, and Apple Calendar.
- **Error Handling**: Resilient to network errors or invalid calendar formats.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `icalendar`

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install requests icalendar
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramhee98/iCalSyncHub.git
cd iCalSyncHub
```

2. Copy the config_template.ini file and customize it according to your requirements:

```bash
cp config_template.ini config.ini
nano config.ini
```

- **`output_path`**: Path where the merged calendar file will be saved.
- **`filename`**: Filename of the .ics file, will be randomized if empty.
- **`sync_interval`**: Time interval (in seconds) between calendar syncs.

3. Create a calendar_urls.txt file in the project directory, listing the calendar URLs to sync:

```bash
https://example.com/calendar1.ics
https://example.com/calendar2.ics
```

4. Run the program:

```bash
python sync_calendars.py
```

The program will fetch the specified calendars, merge their events, and save the result as an iCal file at the configured location. It will then periodically sync the calendars based on the specified interval.
